      "\n",
      "In addition to a wider dissemination, regular HID information and training resources posted to EMS national organization Web sites could foster uniformity in the resources being distributed across EMS agencies nationwide, and may lead to a corresponding improvement in EMS practitioner HID knowledge.Although the majority of respondents noted that orientation training was required before responders were allowed to report to a potential HID scenario, EMS workers were still less than twothirds compliant with undergoing periodic retraining at the Lead and Frontline levels.\n",

      "In brief, wells were coated with monoclonal anti-M-ficolin, incubated with samples diluted in a high ionic strength buffer with EDTA, heat aggregated human IgG and bovine IgG, washed and developed with biotinylated anti-M-ficolin antibody followed by europium-labelled streptavidin, and read on a time-resolved fluorometer.MBL genotyping was performed as previously described [39] .Conditional logistic regression is appropriate to assess the association between CMV disease and plasma MBL in a study Abbreviations: IQR, interquartile range; CMV, cytomegalovirus; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; cART, combination antiretroviral therapy; IRIS, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.\n",

Cases had on average a shorter duration of HIV-infection and lower CD8 T-cell count compared with their controls, but higher HIV RNA levels.MBL levels appeared stable over the range of age of stored samples (in years) for both cases and controls, giving no cause for concern about the quality and stability of stored plasma samples (data not shown).\n",
